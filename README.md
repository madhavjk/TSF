# [1] Simple Linear Regression

### Description:
A machine learning model to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

### Dataset:
Student Dataset (http://bit.ly/w--datadata)

# [2] To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Description:
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 

### Dataset:
Iris Dataset(https://github.com/msharma043510/TSF/blob/master/K-Means%20Clustering/Iris.csv)

### Code:

# [3] To Explore Decision Tree

### Description:
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

### Dataset:
Iris Dataset(https://github.com/msharma043510/TSF/blob/master/Decision%20Tree/Iris.csv)

### Code:
